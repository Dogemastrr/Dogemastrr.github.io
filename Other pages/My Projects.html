            <h2>Monolith Hunter: </h2>
            <br>
            <p>Monolith Hunter is a 2D top down rouge-like(ish) game developed in Godot and set in a world where powerful monoliths bring forth torrents of terrible creatures every time they "break". Ranging from from beings that are barely stronger than the average man to creatures that can tear apart the very fabric of the world itself! Play as a knight(or mage, or brawler) sent into the modern day that can tap into the power of the monoliths to clear areas and unlock new weapons, upgrades, and find cool Easter eggs. Take down bosses one by one with the ultimate goal of preventing the largest Monolith Break the world will ever see,  or at least try to minimize the damage!</p>
